INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================


1. Make the necessary modifications to the PYTHON, JAVA, and ANTLR_JAR
   variables in the Makefile.

2. If you have gcj installed, do:

     make antlr

   to compile a native-code antlr binary, which is much faster than the running
   the Java byte-code binary.

3. To build all the generated python code, do:

     make all

4. To run all the tests, do:

     make tests

5. To see the assembly translation do:

     python translate.py examples/ex*.s

5. To play around with the GUI do:

     python idc.py

   You will need pygtk for that. At the moment it does nothing more than open
   and display a file.

That's all that can be done at the present.
